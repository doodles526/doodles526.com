The other day on [HN](news.ycombinator.com) I read an
article entitled, 
["Write Code Every Day"](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)
and I found it quite profound. The article sets up 3 basic rules:

> 1.    I must write code every day. I can write docs, or blog posts, or other things but it must be in addition to the code that I write.

> 2.    It must be useful code. No tweaking indentation, no code re-formatting, and if at all possible no refactoring. (All these things are permitted, but not as the exclusive work of the day.)

> 3.    All code must be written before midnight.

> 4.    The code must be Open Source and up on Github.

I began to look on the last few years
as a project loving student and part time worker and realized that I
wasn't meeting my goals with regards to the work I put into projects or
the results I saw from that work.

Mostly, I identified that I would work sporadically when I found time,
and that my projects never got finished.  They usually would 
reach a point of being functional, but only being 90% complete - leaving
a large chunk of cosmetic and practical implementation unfinished, and eventually
scrapping parts from that project to produce the next big thing.

My goals for the foreseeable future are far from identical to that document,
however, I wish to use it as a template.  As not all of my projects do not involve
coding, and I don't want those to be at all neglected, I need to tweak my goals as such:

1. I must move a project forward every day.  I can research, write blog posts, or anything in addition to the progress I make.
2. It must be visible progress.  The general rule of thumb here is if no one but me can see a change, then it doesn't count.
Note that I do not consider blogging visible progress. I view this as documentation or research culmination.
3. All progress must be made before midnight.
4. All progress must be documented and put online. (Within reason)  For code this means pushing all work to Github.
For other projects, this means blogging and uploading progress via images/demo and/or blog post. Exception will be made
to non-coding projects that require significant documentation such as vehicle or hardware projects.  If and when this arises, I will
allow the project progress for Monday to be writing up information based on those projects.

This website is the first project in this endeavor, and will be documented in the next post.
